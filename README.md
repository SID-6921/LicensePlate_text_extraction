# 🚗 Car License Plate Detection with YOLOv9 🛡️

Welcome to the **Car License Plate Detection** project, where cutting-edge deep learning meets practical application! This project leverages YOLOv9, the latest in the YOLO series, to deliver highly accurate and efficient license plate detection in real-world scenarios.

## 🌟 Project Overview

In this project, we use YOLOv9 for detecting license plates from images and videos. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is known for its balance between speed and accuracy, making it an ideal choice for real-time applications like license plate recognition.

### Key Features:
- **High Accuracy**: YOLOv9's advanced architecture ensures high precision in detecting license plates, even in challenging environments.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for speed, this model can handle live video feeds or large image batches with minimal latency.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different regions and plate formats by fine-tuning on your dataset.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-license-plate-detection.git
cd car-license-plate-detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download and Prepare the Dataset

Before running the detection, you’ll need to have a dataset of car images with annotated license plates. Update the dataset paths in the notebook as necessary.

### 4. Run the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to perform license plate detection:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

In the notebook interface, open `Car License Plate Detection_ YOLO_V9.ipynb` and execute the cells to see YOLOv9 in action.

### 5. Optional: Convert Notebook to Script

If you prefer running the project as a script, you can convert the notebook:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script "Car License Plate Detection_ YOLO_V9.ipynb"
python "Car License Plate Detection_ YOLO_V9.py"
```

## 📊 Results and Analysis

The notebook provides step-by-step results, including:
- **Detected Plates**: Visualized bounding boxes around detected license plates.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and inference time.
  
Screenshots and performance graphs are included to illustrate the model's capabilities.

## 🔍 Model Details

### YOLOv9 Highlights:
- **New Backbone Architecture**: Improved feature extraction leading to better accuracy.
- **Enhanced NMS**: Better handling of overlapping detections, crucial for crowded scenes.
- **Efficient Training**: Optimized for faster training without compromising on performance.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Looking forward, here are a few ideas for extending this project:
- **Real-Time Integration**: Implement the model in a real-time system using a live camera feed.
- **Multi-Language OCR**: Combine with OCR to read plates in multiple languages.
- **Mobile Deployment**: Optimize the model for deployment on mobile devices using frameworks like TensorFlow Lite.
