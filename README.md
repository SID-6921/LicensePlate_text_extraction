# 🚗 License Plate Detection and Text Extraction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of detecting license plates in images and extracting text from them using a combination of **YOLO** for object detection and **Tesseract** for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

---

## 🛠️ Overview

- **License Plate Detection**: Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to accurately detect license plates in various images.
- **Text Extraction**: After detecting the license plates, the Tesseract OCR engine is employed to extract the text from the detected plates, providing a complete end-to-end solution.
